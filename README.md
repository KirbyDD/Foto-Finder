# Foto-Finder

### by De'Marcus Kirby 
## Intro

	For this project I recreated a website that saves photos to an album section and saves them to localStorage. I followed details of design and layout per the comp that was given to me and added the functionality for the user.


	The user will type in the title and caption and upload the photo. After entering the photo, the user will click the 'Add to Album' button and that photo is saved to a space below it. After creating an photo card the user has the option of editing the title and caption, deleting the idea (permanently), or favoriting the photo. The user can also search their photos via title or caption.

## Goals accomplished

1.	Implemented client side data persistence using local storage.
2.	Established and used two data models, one being a class.
3.	Iterated over DOM elements to filter what was displayed.
4.	Made dry clean code.
5.	Made a responsive layout.
